# Bike Rental Demand Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast hourly bike rental demand in a city's bike-sharing system. By analyzing historical rental data over two years, along with factors such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity, holidays, and working days, the project identifies key factors influencing bike usage. 

The main goal is to provide insights for better bike resource management and urban transportation planning.

The dataset used for this project is from the Kaggle [Bike Sharing Demand dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data). It contains the following key features:

### Models Implemented
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest

### Model Comparison
- **Linear Regression**: Simple and interpretable but limited in capturing complex patterns.
- **Random Forest**: Better accuracy and robust predictions due to its non-linear modeling capabilities.
